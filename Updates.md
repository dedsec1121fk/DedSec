24/12/2024 Serveo stopped working for many of you and me (4uck),so until I find a way to add Ngrok,LocalHost or fic the Serveo,you can access the apps ONLY trough ip links like http://xxx.0.0.x:4040 so that mean you must be in the same network with the other person in order to do it,but you can make a free hotspot etc and/or buy wifi extender to make your work more easily.
If someone manage to fix it DM me on Instagram.

23/12/2024 First I created this file,lol,second,radio mode with unpopular Greek artists in some music genders like rap,rock,punk etc will be added to the main menu so you can listen to some music while doing your things,so stay tuned!

22/12/2024 Now you have an easily menu accessable everytime you open the Terminal,so even the dumb users can use the project,check the Tutorial.md for further information!

15/12/2024 Chats are now supporting no character limit for usernames,file sharing and emojis!
