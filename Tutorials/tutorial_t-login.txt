### 2. Grant Storage Access to Termux
- Open the **Termux** app.
- Run the command:

  termux-setup-storage
  ```
- This command will allow **Termux** to access your device's storage.

### 3. Update Termux

### 5. Create a Folder for the Project
- Create a new directory named **T-Login** in your home directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/T-Login
  ```
- Change to that directory with:
  ```bash
  cd ~/T-Login
  ```

### 6. Create the Python Script
- Use a text editor (like `nano`) to create a new file called `t-login.py`:
  ```bash
  nano t-login.py
  ```
- Paste the provided Python code into the editor.
- Save the file and exit the text editor by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `ENTER`.

### 7. Run the Program

- Enter your desired username and password when asked.
- This will create a login screen that requires credentials before accessing your Termux shell.

### 9. Enable Auto-Login on Start
- After setting up the credentials, the script will modify the `.bash_profile` to ensure the login script runs each time you open a new Termux session.

### 10. Remove the Login Screen
