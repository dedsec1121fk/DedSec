### 1. Install Termux
- Download the F-Droid app store from its official website.
- Open the F-Droid app and search for **Termux**.
- Install **Termux** from the F-Droid store.

### 2. Grant Storage Access to Termux
- Open the **Termux** app.
- Run the command:
  ```bash
  termux-setup-storage
  ```
- This command will allow **Termux** to access your device's storage.

### 3. Update Termux
- In the **Termux** terminal, run the command:
  ```bash
  pkg update && pkg upgrade
  ```
- This ensures that all packages are up to date.

### 4. Install Python
- Type the following command to install Python:
  ```bash
  pkg install python
  ```

### 5. Create a Folder for the Project
- Create a new directory named **Customization** in your home directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/Customization
  ```
- Change to that directory with:
  ```bash
  cd ~/Customization
  ```

### 6. Create the Python Script
- Use a text editor (like `nano`) to create a new file called `customization.py`:
  ```bash
  nano customization.py
  ```
- Paste the provided Python code into the editor.
- Save the file and exit the text editor by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `ENTER`.

### 7. Run the Program
- Start the program by typing:
  ```bash
  python customization.py
  ```
- The program will remove the existing **motd** (message of the day) file and create a new one with custom ASCII art. It will also modify the **bash.bashrc** file to customize the command prompt.

### 8. Verify Changes

#### **Check the ASCII Art (motd)**
- After running the script, restart **Termux** or open a new session to see the custom ASCII art when you start the terminal.
  
  The **motd** should display something like:
  ```
    ___         _ ___           _ _ ___ _ 
   |   \ ___ __| / __| ___ __  / / |_  ) |
   | |) / -_) _` \__ \/ -_) _| | | |/ /| |
   |___/\___\__,_|___/\___\__| |_|_/___|_|
  ```

#### **Check the Customized Command Prompt**
- After restarting the terminal or starting a new session, your command prompt should look like this:
  ```
  üåê Tue Oct 15 ‚è∞ 14:32 üíª dedsec1121fk üìÇ ~ :
  ```
  - The prompt shows the current date, time, username (dedsec1121fk), and the current working directory (`~` for the home directory).

### 9. Modify the Customization

- If you want to further modify the ASCII art or the prompt style:
  - **Modify ASCII Art**: Edit the `modify_motd()` function to change the design of the ASCII art.
  - **Modify the Prompt**: Update the `new_ps1` line in the `modify_bashrc()` function to customize the prompt style, adding new symbols or colors.

### 10. Stop and Revert Changes
- To remove the customizations and revert to the default settings, you can manually restore the original **motd** and **bash.bashrc** files by editing them or replacing them with backups.
