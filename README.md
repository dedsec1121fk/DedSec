Welcome to the DedSec Project! Our mission is to empower you by revealing how real-world threats operate. This toolkit is packed with educational scripts, showing you how phishing attacks steal camera images and location data, or how to chat securely with an encrypted client. Everything here is completely free and designed to turn you from a target into a defender.
