##Data Management:
Extract images, generate custom links, and manage information efficiently with automated tools.

##Customizations:
Personalize themes and settings to tailor the toolkit to your workflow.

##Radio Streaming:
Stream radio content, including offline Greek stations, with easy-to-use playback controls.

##Streamlined Navigation:
Access all DedSec tools via an interactive menu with built-in update mechanisms to keep the project current.
