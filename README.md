Welcome to the **DedSec Project**! Our mission is to empower you by revealing how real-world threats operate. This toolkit is packed with educational scripts, showing you how phishing attacks steal camera images and location data, or how to chat securely with an encrypted client. Everything here is completely free and designed to turn you from a target into a defender.

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

Get the DedSec Project running on your **Android device with Termux**.

### Requirements

| Component | Minimum Specification |
| :-------- | :-------------------- |
| **Device** | Android with [Termux](https://f-droid.org/) installed |
| **Storage** | **3GB** of free space (Radio, images, and recordings will consume more space.) |
| **RAM** | **2GB** |

### Step-by-Step Setup

> **Note:** For best results, install Termux from the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) store. This ensures you can also install necessary add-ons like `Termux:API`. You may need to enable "**Install Unknown Apps**" in your Android settings.

1.  **Install Packages & Grant Permissions**
    Open Termux and run the following command to set up storage and install necessary packages:
    ```bash
    termux-setup-storage && pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y && pkg install aapt clang cloudflared curl ffmpeg fzf git jq libffi libffi-dev libxml2 libxslt nano ncurses nodejs openssh openssl openssl-tool proot python rust unzip wget zip -y
    ```

2.  **Install Python Libraries**
    Install the required Python modules using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install blessed bs4 cryptography flask flask-socketio geopy mutagen phonenumbers pycountry pydub pycryptodome requests werkzeug
    ```

3.  **Install Termux API**
    This package allows the scripts to interact with Android's native features:
    ```bash
    pkg install termux-api
    ```

4.  **Clone the Repository**
    Download the project files from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dedsec1121fk/DedSec](https://github.com/dedsec1121fk/DedSec)
    ```
    > **üí° Tip:** If you get an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'`, run `pip install requests` and try again.

5.  **Run the Project**
    Navigate into the project directory and run the settings script to begin:
    ```bash
    cd DedSec/Scripts && python Settings.py
    ```
    > **üí° Tip:** You can open the main menu later by just typing `m` in Termux.
