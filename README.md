## DedSec Project Features
## 1. **blank_page_back_camera.py** Creates a minimal or “blank” webpage that silently requests access to the device’s **back camera**. Once permission is granted (intentionally or unintentionally), the script captures video or images. - **Primary Use**: Demonstrates how deceptive webpages can trick users into granting camera access. - **Key Functionality**: - Generates a webpage with minimal or no visible content. - Requests back-camera permission. - Captures and stores images or video streams once access is granted. --- ## 2. **blank_page_front_camera.py** Similar to `blank_page_back_camera.py`, but targets the **front camera** (often used for selfies or video calls). - **Primary Use**: Highlights how easily a user’s front camera can be accessed through disguised permissions. - **Key Functionality**: - Renders a seemingly blank or harmless page. - Requests front-camera permission. - Collects snapshots or video streams if the user consents. --- ## 3. **blank_page_location.py** Displays a minimal webpage that requests and collects **geolocation data** from the user’s browser. - **Primary Use**: Demonstrates how websites can gather location data with minimal user awareness. - **Key Functionality**: - Leverages HTML5 or browser APIs to request geolocation. - Logs latitude, longitude, and possibly additional metadata (e.g., accuracy, timestamp). - Stores or transmits location data for analysis. --- ## 4. **blank_page_microphone.py** Creates a deceptive webpage that requests **microphone access**, recording audio upon permission. - **Primary Use**: Illustrates the risk of granting microphone permissions to untrusted pages. - **Key Functionality**: - Presents a plain webpage with little or no content. - Requests microphone access from the user’s browser. - Records and saves audio streams if access is approved. --- ## 5. **customization.py** Allows users to modify and configure **DedSec project settings** or interface elements. - **Primary Use**: Enhances the user experience by providing theme customization, color schemes, or other adjustable parameters. - **Key Functionality**: - Updates visual styles, terminal prompts, or script output formats. - Persists user preferences for consistent customization across sessions. - May include a rollback or default option to restore original settings. --- ## 6. **dedsec_database.py** Handles data storage and retrieval for the DedSec project. - **Primary Use**: Manages structured data, such as logs, user credentials, or configuration details. - **Key Functionality**: - Provides create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. - Potentially interacts with SQLite or another lightweight database system. -

**Primary Use**: Showcases advanced or alternative methods to record audio. - **Key Functionality**: - May include hidden triggers, timing intervals, or extended logging. - Stores recordings locally or sends them to a remote server. - Incorporates methods to avoid user suspicion. --- ## 11. **fox_chat.py** Another chat application or module, potentially using a different framework or protocol than `dedsecs_chat.py`. - **Primary Use**: Provides an alternative secure messaging platform. - **Key Functionality**: - Could offer unique encryption algorithms or user management. - Supports multi-user chat sessions, direct messages, or broadcast features. - May focus on performance, scalability, or a different user interface. --- ## 12. **image_extractor.py** Searches for and extracts image files from specified sources. -

**Key Functionality**: - Generates short or random URLs. - Tracks link usage or logs user interactions. - Potentially integrates with third-party URL-shortening APIs. --- ## 14. **login_page_back_camera.py** Displays a **fake login page** that secretly activates the back camera. - **Primary Use**: Demonstrates how deceptive login forms can capture camera footage during credential entry. - **Key Functionality**: - Presents a realistic login interface. - Requests back-camera permission in the background. - Captures or streams video/images without user awareness. --- ## 15. **login_page_front_camera.py** A variation of the above script targeting the **front camera**. - **Primary Use**: Highlights the ease with which front-camera access can be hidden within a login form. - **Key Functionality**: - Mimics legitimate sign-in pages. - Captures images or video from the user’s front camera upon permission. - Potentially logs credentials alongside camera data. --- ## 16. **login_page_location_hacker.py** A deceptive login page engineered to gather **geolocation data**. - **Primary Use**: Illustrates how location data can be obtained under the guise of a standard login process. - **Key Functionality**: - Uses browser-based geolocation prompts or other IP-based methods. - Collects and stores user coordinates upon acceptance. - May combine location data with any credentials submitted. --- ## 17. **login_page_microphone.py** Captures **microphone audio** while displaying a fraudulent login interface. - **Primary Use**: Emphasizes the risk of granting microphone access on apparently benign login forms. - **Key Functionality**: - Embeds microphone permission requests in the login flow. - Records and saves user audio once permission is granted. - Potentially merges recorded data with any typed credentials. --- ## 18. **menu.py** A centralized script providing an **interactive menu** for launching the various DedSec tools. - **Primary Use**: Organizes the scripts into a navigable interface for quick access. -

Files are saved in named folders (e.g., Camera-Phish) in your internal storage (in the Download folder). Use a file explorer to access them. In the Camera-Phish folder, add images camera.jpg and casino.jpg. In the Recordings folder, add record.jpg, and in the LocationData folder, add locate.jpg after the first use of the phishing pages.
