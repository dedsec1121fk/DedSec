## üöÄ Installation & Usage (Command-Line Tools)

Get the DedSec Project command-line tools running on your **Android device with Termux**.

### Requirements

| Component | Minimum Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Device** | Android with [Termux](https://f-droid.org/) installed |
| **Storage** | **3GB** of free space (Radio, images, and recordings consume more space.) |
| **RAM** | **2GB** |

### Step-by-Step Setup

> **Note:** For best results, install Termux from the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) store. This ensures you can also install necessary add-ons like `Termux:API`. You may need to enable "**Install Unknown Apps**" in your Android settings.

1.  **Install Packages & Grant Permissions**
    Open Termux and run the following command to set up storage and install necessary packages:
    ```bash
    termux-setup-storage && pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y && pkg install aapt clang cloudflared curl ffmpeg fzf git jq libffi libffi-dev libxml2 libxslt nano ncurses nodejs openssh openssl openssl-tool proot python rust unzip wget zip -y
    ```

2.  **Install Python Libraries**
    Install the required Python modules using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install blessed bs4 cryptography flask flask-socketio geopy mutagen phonenumbers pycountry pydub pycryptodome requests werkzeug
    ```

3.  **Install Termux API**
    This package allows the scripts to interact with Android's native features:
    ```bash
    pkg install termux-api
    ```

4.  **Clone the Repository**
    Download the project files from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dedsec1121fk/DedSec](https://github.com/dedsec1121fk/DedSec)
    ```
    > **üí° Tip:** If you get an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'`, run `pip install requests` and try again.

5.  **Run the Project**
    Navigate into the project directory and run the settings script to begin:
    ```bash
    cd DedSec/Scripts && python Settings.py
    ```
    > **üí° Tip:** You can open the main menu later by just typing `m` in Termux.

## üõ°Ô∏è Digital Self-Defense Toolkit

This toolkit contains various scripts for **educational and defensive purposes only**. Their function is to demonstrate how common attacks work so you can learn to recognize and protect yourself against them.

* **Fox Chat & Utilities**: Includes various scripts like encrypted chat, an offline radio player, app management, and the settings menu to update the project.
* **Phishing Demonstrations**: Modules that show how a malicious webpage can trick a user into giving away camera, microphone, and location access. For your self-tests, any captured data is saved locally into your phone's main **Downloads** folder.
* **SocialBrute**: A script designed to demonstrate the weakness of simple or reused passwords by showing how automated attacks work.
* **URL Masker & HTML Finder**: Educational tools to help you understand how web pages are structured and how links can be disguised.
