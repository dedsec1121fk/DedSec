## Overview

This repository contains two Flask-based chat applications that integrate real-time messaging and file sharing. Both systems employ Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket communication, enabling seamless interaction among users.

---

## Application 1: Fox Chat (`fox_chat.py`)

### Purpose
Fox Chat offers a real-time chat platform where users can exchange text messages and share files within an interactive web interface.

### Features
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Facilitates instant communication between users.
- **File Sharing**: Allows users to upload and share files, which can be downloaded by others.
- **User Nicknames**: Users can set unique nicknames that persist across sessions using local storage.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable interface for both dark and light themes.
- **Message History**: Newly connected users receive the chat history to stay updated.

### Workflow
1. Users are prompted to enter a nickname upon joining the chat.
2. Messages are exchanged in real time, with each user's nickname displayed alongside their message.
3. Files can be uploaded and shared via the **Send File** button, and links are generated for others to download.

### Technical Highlights
- **Backend Framework**: Flask-SocketIO handles WebSocket connections for real-time updates.
- **Frontend Integration**: Uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for a responsive chat interface.
- **File Handling**: Files are uploaded to a designated directory and served via Flask's file routing.

## Application 2: DedSecâ€™s Chat (`dedsecs_chat.py`)

### Purpose
DedSec's Chat is a secure, real-time chat platform designed for group interactions, with support for text messaging and file sharing.

### Features
- **Secure File Uploads**: Files are saved with sanitized filenames using `secure_filename` to prevent malicious input.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Broadcasts messages and file links instantly to all connected users.
- **Persistent Nicknames**: Users can set nicknames that are stored in local storage for future sessions.
- **Adaptive UI**: A sleek, responsive design adjusts for dark and light system themes.
- **Dynamic File Links**: Generates unique, accessible links for every uploaded file.

### Workflow
1. Users are prompted to enter a nickname upon joining the chat.
2. Real-time communication allows participants to exchange messages instantly.
3. File uploads are processed securely, and links to the files are shared in the chat.

### Technical Highlights
- **Backend Framework**: Flask-SocketIO manages WebSocket connections for seamless communication.
- **Frontend Integration**: Combines HTML and JavaScript to create a dynamic user interface.
- **File Safety**: Employs `secure_filename` from Werkzeug to mitigate risks associated with file uploads.
